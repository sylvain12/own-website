    <span class="text-[9rem] font-thin">Hi</span>, <span class="text-[4rem] text-main font-bold">Sylvain Kadjo</span>, I'm a software engineer, and sometimes I do <span class="link span-orange">UI/UX design</span> and <span class="link span-orange">data analysis</span> stuff. After my diploma in computer networks and telecommunications, I did some internships and then decided to become a developer.
  </p>

  <p>
    I started by training myself in programming, then I did a bachelor's in software engineering. Currently, I work as a front-end software engineer at <a class="link link-main" href="www.sejen.ci" target="_blank">SEJEN</a> in Ivory Coast, a data science and software engineering company.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of my job, I also give programming training in schools, I'm part of several developer communities like <a class="link link-main" href="www.sejen.ci" target="_blank">GDG Abidjan</a>, and <a class="link link-main" href="www.sejen.ci" target="_blank">Python CÃ´te d'Ivoire</a>, and I like to have a good time with my family, enjoy with my friends, and discover new things. What characterizes me is my <span class="text-[5rem] text-main">smile</span>, <span class="text-[5rem] text-main">team spirit</span>, and <span class="text-[5rem] text-main">motivation</span> to always seek to <span class="link span-orange">improve</span> and thus impact my environment.
